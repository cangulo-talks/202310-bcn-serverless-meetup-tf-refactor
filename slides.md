# **Goal**

We want to refactor and simplify a terraform solution. _How would you tackle this ? ðŸ¤”_

<!-- TODO: add screenshot of terraform code -->

---

# **Problem**

* We edit the code and we perform a terraform plan to ensure our changes do what we expect. ðŸ“œ
* If we have 3 environments, we check 3 terraform plans. But, what if we have hundreds of environments? ðŸ’¯

# **What do we need?**

- We need to aggregate all the environments changes so it is easy for us to know how our changes affect them

<!-- TODO: add screenshot of tf plans summary -->

---

# **Our solution**

- We need to aggregate all the environments changes so it is easy for us to know how our changes affect them
- We end up creating a open source GH action for it:
  - [terraform-plan-summarize-gh-action](https://github.com/ohpensource/terraform-plan-summarize-gh-action)
